## MyReads: A Book Lending app
This is the code for MyReads: A Book Lending App project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

There is a **Main Page** with 3 shelves for books
and there is a **Search Page** where books can be searched.

Each book has a control which can be used to categorize a book as *currently reading*, *want to read*, or *read*.

Use *npm install* to install.

Use *npm start* to launch the app
